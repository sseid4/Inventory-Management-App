# Inventory-Management-App

This Flutter app implements an inventory management UI backed by Firestore.

Implemented enhanced features
- Advanced Search & Filtering — real-time search by item name, category filter, and a "Low stock" filter (client-side filtering applied to the live items stream).
- Data Insights Dashboard — a simple dashboard screen showing total unique items, total inventory value (sum of quantity × price), and a list of out-of-stock items.

Quick run instructions
1. Ensure you have Flutter installed and a connected device or simulator.
2. From the project root, fetch packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```
